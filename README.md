# Assistance from ChatGPT

- Code to make card image sizes and text boxes align in size
- Code to have quotes randomly displayed at the top of the page (with guidance from me regarding the quotes and prompt engineering)
- Code to have the leaflet map display specific coordinates at random intensity values
- Code to have the leaflet map load coordinates from a CSV file in the directory instead of having the values hardcoded.
