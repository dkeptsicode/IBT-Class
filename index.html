                        <p class="card-text">I am currently serving as the Director of Product for Poly Platform, a "Smart-City" civic engagement app that allows municipalities to digitize their constituent services and improve the way the communicate with their residents. We hope to ultimately revolutionize the way our democracy responds to the needs of its people.

                            I am highly interested in emerging technology, particularly new applications for the distributed ledger technology utilized by blockchain as well as generative AI.
                            
                            Prior to my MBA at Georgetown, I worked as a Research Analyst at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) specializing in the Energy practice area. I have extensive experience in market analysis using a variety of proprietary databases such as:

                                <li>S&P Capital IQ</li>
                                <li>Thomson Reuters Eikon</li>

                            </ul> 
                            I have also previously worked on Capitol Hill as a congressional legislative intern at the U.S. House of Representatives and a policy research intern for the Cato Institute. In my free time, I enjoy listening to history podcasts and watching UFC.</p>
